# Real-Time Audio Visualisation Project.

This project was focussed at modifying Unity object properties via audio components such as pitch. The user is allowed to link the properties to the object components.

There are  limited operators available for limited manipulation of the audio values.

For this project, the user is required to have Max MSP to capture the sound and to sent it to Unity via UPD connection.
